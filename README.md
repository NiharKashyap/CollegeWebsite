# CollegeWebsite
5th sem project

This project is my 5th sem Web Technology project. We were asked to design a replica of our college website. 

I used django framework to build this project. The web pages were designed with HTML, CSS and some JavaScript for validations. It is currently deployed in pythonanywhere

Original College Website:http://jist.ac.in

My deployed website: http://niharkashyap.pythonanywhere.com
